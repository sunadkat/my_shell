Thi shell mimics some functionality of the linux system shell. 

My shell supports: 
- Multiple piping
- Internal commads cd to change directory and exit to exit the shell
- Change of input line buffer size at the top of the file 


To Compile: 
"make" compiles into executable "my_shell", "make clean" to clear this. 

Reference Files: 
- shell-pipe.c from class to help with implementing piping 
- Used "Hints for Assignment One" main loop and system calls 
- Looked at : brennan.io/2015/01/16/write-a-shell-in-c/ to help with parsing the input line 
- Looked at all websites listed in FAQ (gnu.org) on sample shell creation 
- Also asked TA for help
