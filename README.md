My_shell is a script that mimics basic functionalities of the Linux system shell. 

My _shell supports: 
- Multiple piping
- Internal commands: 'cd' to change change directory, and 'exit' to terminate the shell
- Change of input line buffer size at the top of the file 

To Compile: 
Use command "make" to compile the script into an executable "my_shell" file. Use "make clean" to clear remove these files.
